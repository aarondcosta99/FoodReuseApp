# Food Reuse App
Food Reuse App is an Android app that displayed people wanting to donate food, to those looking to receive and  connect them with each other and chat on the app itself. The app also allowed users to directly donate to mainstream NGO's/Food-banks like The Robin Hood Army, Zomato Feeding India and Mumbai Roti Bank.

This app was developed on Android Studio in Java. The database used was Google's Cloud Firestore. Sending and receiving notifications on the app were implemented by making use of Firebase Cloud Functions and Firebase Cloud Messaging. The language used to write the functions was JavaScript and it was executed using Node.js.

Important Note: Deployment of functions to the Node.js 8 runtime was disabled in the Firebase CLI on December 15, 2020. Hence I have not not included the notification feature in the repository and nor will notifications appear while using the app.
